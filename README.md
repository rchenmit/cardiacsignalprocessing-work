Signal processing

Kalman filter

lowpass

highpass

1. look up papers on heart motion (e.g. from 1950s): circulation, circulation res, AJP physio, etc

2. correct SCG/deviation signal for the shift - fixed

3. better way to integrate SCG - did "signal-mean" at each step; used kalm to integrate accel --> velocity; used cumtrap to integrate velocity --> position

1. look up papers on heart motion (e.g. from 1950s): circulation, circulation res, AJP physio, etc

2. check integration of SCG -- not sure if it is good
